The files in this archive demosntrate the usage of MOD-MPU6050 under Arduino IDE.

OLIMEXINO-328 was used during testing. Arduino IDE version 1.0.6 was used (under Windows 7 x64). For best results, keep the setup the same!

How to use the example:

1. Download and extract the archive with the example.

2. Inside the main folder there are two folders and this text document.

3. Navigate inside the "LIBRARIES" folder and copy the two folders ("I2Cdev" and "MPU6050") to the libraries folder of Arduino IDE. The path to it here was: <PATH_TO_EXTRACT_FOLDER>\arduino-1.0.6-windows\arduino-1.0.6\libraries

4. Start Arduino IDE open the MPU6050_test.ino file from the folder "MPU6050_test" (located in the main folder of the archive). Compile and you are good to go.

Refer to the comments in the MPU6050_test.ino for detailed information.
